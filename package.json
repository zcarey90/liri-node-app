  "description": "1. This app is basically like SIRI but while SIRI is for speech interpretation LIRI is for speech interpretation. 2. This app allows the user to find anything they want about movies or concerts through a few different API's. 3. Give start-to-finish instructions on how to run the app. All of the files are important to running the app but no other file is as crucial to running the app like Liri.js is. This file lays out the everything for the API's to work so the user can properly find the information when they do an API call. 4. Include screenshots, gifs or videos of the app functioning 5. Contain a link to a deployed version of the app 6. Clearly list the technologies used in the app. I used the Spotify developer and VS code. 7. State your role in the app development. I am a beginner at this. This was for a homework assignment.",
